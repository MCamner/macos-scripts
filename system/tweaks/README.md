## 🧪 Safe Testing (Recommended)

Always start with:

```bash
./system/tweaks/macos-tweaks.sh all --dry-run
```

This shows exactly what will change without applying anything.

Optimized for development:

* Show hidden files
* Show file extensions
* Faster keyboard repeat
* Dock auto-hide (instant)

---

### 🎯 clean

---

## 💾 Backup & Revert

Backup is automatically created before applying tweaks.

Manual backup:

```bash
./system/tweaks/macos-tweaks.sh backup
```

Revert to latest:

```bash
./system/tweaks/macos-tweaks.sh revert-latest
```

Backups are stored in:

```text
~/.macos-tweaks-backup/
```

---

## 🔍 Status Inspection

View current system configuration:

```bash
./system/tweaks/macos-tweaks.sh status
```

---

## 🔌 mqlaunch Integration

Example integration:

```bash
tweaks) bash "$BASE_DIR/system/tweaks/macos-tweaks.sh" menu ;;
tweaks-status) bash "$BASE_DIR/system/tweaks/macos-tweaks.sh" status ;;
tweaks-workstation) bash "$BASE_DIR/system/tweaks/macos-tweaks.sh" workstation ;;
tweaks-all) bash "$BASE_DIR/system/tweaks/macos-tweaks.sh" all ;;
tweaks-revert) bash "$BASE_DIR/system/tweaks/macos-tweaks.sh" revert-latest ;;
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Uses `defaults write` → changes are system-level preferences
* Some changes require app restart (handled automatically)
* Behavior may vary slightly between macOS versions
* Always use `--dry-run` before applying on a new system

---

## 🧱 Design Philosophy

This is not a random tweak dump.

It is:

* Structured
* Reversible
* Scriptable
* Extensible

Think of it as:

> “Infrastructure-as-code for your macOS UX”

---

## 🔮 Future Ideas

* Additional profiles (minimal, secure, power-user)
* Per-setting revert
* JSON/YAML config support
* Remote deployment (MDM-style)

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Add tweaks by extending:

* `apply_*_tweaks()` functions
* `backup_selected()` mappings
* `show_status()` output

Keep it:

* Minimal
* Reversible
* Tested
